A tool to determine the single-source shortest path lengths from a designated node using a distributed variation of the classical breadth-first search over a graph. In this case the graph consists of English Wikipedia articles as nodes and directed edges between articles A and B if article A links to article B. The article name for the "source" node is to be hard coded in the file (as a variable named 'source').
